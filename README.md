<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>This repository (<strong>CPP TFTP Server</strong>) is intended to be a simple and pure C++(20) command line utility.</p>

<p>The tests directory contains executable Bash scripts for testing the (debug build) of the binary.</p>

<p>The motivation behind this project was mostly as an educational exercise for its author to learn more about network programming. Your mileage may vary if you try to use it in a production environment!</p>
